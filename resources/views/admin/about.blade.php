          <h1>About Me</h1><br>
          <p>I am a director of brand marketing, with experience managing global teams and multi-million-dollar campaigns.
            My background in brand strategy, visual design, and account management informs my mindful but competitive approach. 
            Madison is fueled by her passion for understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising. 
            I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my academic foundations in psychology and sociology and 
            stay in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through continued coursework.<br><br>

            My hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to most recent success at 
            Rockwell Group, where I led international, award-winning campaigns for heavy-hitting brands, such as Puma, Gucci, and Rolex. 
            Meanwhile, I vastly improved the productivity of my team by implementing strategic project management methods and 
            ensuring a work-life balance for my department.<br><br>

            I believe mindfulness in the workplace is key to success - a tenet I live out through my interests in yoga, 
            meditation, gardening, and painting. I am currently working as a freelance marketing director and am always interested 
            in a challenge. Reach out to riya@gmail.com to connect!</p><br><br>
